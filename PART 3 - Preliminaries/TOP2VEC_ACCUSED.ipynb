well know the situation of the pedagological institutions, and I knew that Pol Pot realized that the professor was working in that institute and Chao Seng (phonetic) was the chairman of the association and Mai Man (phonetic) was the professor at that school; actually, he was director of that university.  And Sous Nou alias Chou (phonetic), was also a senior professor at that school and later on he was the Secretary of Sector 24. So Son Sen clearly ordered me to monitor the activity of Sous Nou alias Chou (phonetic), and through my monitoring activities I learned that he was not implicated in that matter. So the fact that if I knew the professor was detained there -- if I knew that and the interrogation would then focus on all these links but, as I said, I did not know he was detained.  That's why there was no annotation that I made on the confession. And this is my response.\",\n","       \"And the third point or quality of Chao Seng was that he established the pedagogical institution which later on I entered and studied there.  So he was the fourth person. And next Khieu Komar, the fifth person.  In 1963, '64, the demonstrations were everywhere at the Sisowath school and he defended the progressive students who rebelled at the time.  And at the pedagogical institute I, myself, including Chum Nareth and the rest were mistreated by Kao Lun and my professor defended us. That's why I respected my professor because he defended us and not to let them mistreat us, the progressive people. These people I knew.  I knew that Khieu Komar was evacuated along Road number 4 and he was executed if he was sent to the south by Ta Mok.  So this is the trust that I had.  And Roath Gut stayed with me and I protected him and Chao Seng.  The Communist Party of Kampuchea sent him to me.  I could not do anything.  The best I could do was to provide him with sufficient food and proper accommodation.\",\n","       \"Mr. President, the reason I made it in my observation is that it was just the beginning, because at that time the intellectuals who ran away after the demonstration against Lon Nol, they were included Mam Nai in 1973 and then Chum Narith, Nuon Khoeun (phonetic), Prum Sam Ar, Kong Sokhun and, six, Tuon Sokphala.  So I remember their names because I had followed their account closely. However, when I researched further I found the following names. I found Nuon Khoeun and Tuon Sokphala but I did not see the name of Sokphala (sic).  I knew that Sokhun was known to me because Son Sen told me that he committed suicide at the Ministry of Education, supervised by Sister Yon Yat. I did not see Chum Narith in the list but there was a record about Kem Sovannary, so I believe that when Kem Sovannary was there, so Chum Narith could have been there too.  Chum Sirath was recorded as the medic from the co-operative, so I think these people were arrested on different accounts, while Chum Narith was arrested based on the previous implications in other people's confessions.\",\n","       'Mr. President, I would like to clarify that I have never known this Comrade Met.  During the confrontation arranged by the Co-Investigating Judges, I knew Met was a younger brother of Comrade Mein (phonetic) due to the physical appearance, and that he was a member of the S-21 staff, a member of the special force working outside.  And when I saw the face of Met, I was shocked and regretful that Mein (phonetic) and his wife, Peun (phonetic), who died at S-21 and that I had a pity on Met who was demoted from a guard at S-21 and was later transferred to worked in the rice fields; that was my feeling for Comrade Met.',\n","       \"I never went to Tuy's place.  Of course I was aware of what was going on and I knew that Tuy used violence on the prisoners, but I did not simply react to anything happening at S-21.  I think I went once to Tuy's location when a secretary from Tuek Phos (phonetic) district was arrested, named Chao Van (phonetic), alias Kim (phonetic).\",\n","       'Mr. President, before 7 January 1979 I never knew the face of Tay Teng.  When I met him it was when the Co-Investigating Judges sent me to Choeung Ek for the reconstruction and that was the time I knew Comrade Teng was a cousin of Comrade Tem and Saroeun. These two were in the regiments and after their cousins were arrested, Tay Teng was sent from the special force to station at Choeung Ek.  From my recollection, there were four of them and they were responsible for digging the pits and bury the pits and guard the ground. Therefore, Tay Teng was indeed a member of S-21 staff.  I do not deny this and the content of his statements I agreed in principle.  This is my observation, Mr. President.',\n","       \"This Chao Van (phonetic) was a former resistant.  He was two or three years older than me.  He was from the Daun Penh area.  He was a friend of Son Visoth (phonetic), alias Nikon (phonetic), the younger brother of Son Sen.  And when Chao Van (phonetic) was arrested, my superior telephoned me from afar to play politics with Chao Van (phonetic) in order for him to confess. So I agreed to do so and, from my recollection, Chao Van even wrote that I went to meet him and that he was waiting for me, in his confession.  But I don't want to talk about his confession before this Chamber now, but I believe it was mentioned in his confession.\",\n","       \"And a few days ago I also stated that occasionally I went to visit Chao Seng and on one occasion he talked about the situation during the Sihanouk regime, and I mentioned that before this Chamber, and that I supported Chao Seng, and it is my idea of paying my gratitude to him. And for my professor, I did not know of his detention or that he was suffering from insufficient food or the living condition. That's why I was moved after hearing that. And this is my response, Mr. President and Your Honour, and if you have more questions regarding this matter I am ready to answer.\",\n","       'I regretted if I knew my professor was sent there.  Of course I would not ask for him to be spared but he would be able to live in a better condition as my gratitude for him.  Therefore, later on, in 1993, the VOA broadcast about the production Chhlang Den and the director was Thing Sun.  And I heard and I was surprised. How could Thing Sun became the manager of the production of that musical company?  But at the Military Court I was asked about Professor Phung Ton.  Kar Savuth asked me and I protested that no, he was not there.  And that Oeng Pich took the ashes to his kin and later on he went, if Kar Savuth now is representing me I still maintain that he was not there.',\n","       \"The arrest of my professor to S-21 or whether he was sent from Boeng Trabek or not, I did not have the knowledge of that.  S-21 vehicle did not bear any plate number, although I do not deny to the testimony of Ham Heng Kheng and the other person.  And I knew this person, Ham Heng Kheng.  He used to be my former maid. But the background and history of S-21, as we all know, there were two chairman.  Nat was from the establishment on the 15th of August of '75 until March 1976 when he was removed and replaced by me.\"],\n","      dtype=object)"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":18}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"VMuHQN4SQsdZ"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
